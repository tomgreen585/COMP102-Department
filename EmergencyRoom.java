/**
 * Simulation of an EmergencyRoom,
 * The Emergency room has a collection of departments for treating patients (ER beds, X-ray,
 *  Operating Theatre, MRI, Ultrasound, etc).
 * 
 * When patients arrive at the emergency room, they are immediately assessed by the
 *  triage team who determine the priority of the patient and a sequence of treatments
 *  that the patient will need.
 *
 * Each department has
 *  - a Set of patients that they are currently treating,
 *    (There is a maximum size of this set for each department)
 *  - a Queue for the patients waiting for that department.
 *
 * The departments should be in a Map, with the department name (= treatment type) as the key.
 * 
 * When a patient has finished a treatment, they should be moved to the
 *   department for the next treatment they require.
 *
 * When a patient has finished all their treatments, they should be discharged:
 *  - a record of their total time, treatment time, and wait time should be printed,
 *  - the details should be added to the statistics. 
 *
 *
 * The main simulation should consist of
 * a setting up phase which initialises all the queues,
 * a loop that steps through time:
 *   - advances the time by one "tick"
 *   - Processes one time tick for each patient currently in each department
 *     (either making them wait if they are on the queue, or
 *      advancing their treatment if they are being treated)
 *   - Checks for any patients who have completed their current treatment,
 *      and remove from the department
 *   - Move all Patients that completed a treatment to their next department (or discharge them)
 *   - Checks each department, and moves patients from the front of the
 *       waiting queues into the Sets of patients being treated, if there is room
 *   - Gets any new patient that has arrived (depends on arrivalInterval) and
 *       puts them on the appropriate queue
 *   - Redraws all the departments - showing the patients being treated, and
 *     the patients waiting in the queues
 *   - Pauses briefly
 *
 * The simple simulation just has one department - ER beds that can treat 5 people at once.
 * Patients arrive and need treatment for random times.
